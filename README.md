# Bikeshare


### Introduction

The data for this analysis is from `Motivate`, a global bike share operator that has bike share program in Washington, DC, Boston, New York, San Francisco, Columbus, OH, Portland, and Chicago. 

For this analysis, I am interested in studying the behavior difference in user type between riders in `Chicago` and `New York City`.

**Variables**:

- Trip duration: in seconds
- User type: 
    - Customer: Single rider, those without an annual membership.
    - Subscribers: Annual membership holders
- Genders
- Birth year
- Month, Weekday and Hour extracted from Start time

### Questions to be answered:

**Goal** of this analysis is to see if thereâ€™s any behavior difference between subscriber and customers.

1. What is the average trip duration for each user type in both cities? 
2. Does trip duration for each user type differs based on gender? month? day of the week? hour? birth year?

### Conclusion:

On average, customers uses the bike longer than subscribers in both cities. Trip duration for customers in New York is 4 times higher than duration for subscribers. This may due to the fact that NYC is a tourist heavy destination. 

In both cities, subscriber behavior is quite consistent across all the variables we look at: gender, month, day of the week and hour. Customer behavior on the other hand, shows a bigger variability. More customers ride bike in the weekend than subscribers in Chicago. This differences in not prevalent in New York.
